This is a simple Tech Demo of the first dungeon in the Legend of Zelda.

## Contributing
While I appriciate any input and I know many developers could write cleaner and better code, I'm shelving this for a bit. If you wish to fork it and do your own thing, I'm 100% supportive and would love to see how you have improved the demo!
